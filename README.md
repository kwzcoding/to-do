To-do!
==================
## What this project does
To-do! lets you input your own assignments and tasks, and then gives reminders based on your own specification on how long before the deadline. In addition, To-Do! will help make sure you are on track to finish by the deadline.
## Why this project is useful
People often forget due dates on assignments and critical deadlines, either in work or school, and a to-do list that would not only help remind people but also guide them to make sure I would be able to finish on time would be a major help.
## How we built this 
We built it using Qoom and the languages JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
We're proud of making a working To-Do list website and overcoming challenges in the process.
## What is next for this project
We plan to expand our website and advertise for more people to use our website.
